# JavaScriptWeek
This is a series of JavaScript projects from week 2 at SD Learn. For convenience, I've included a local file of bootstrap.css and jquery-2.1.4.min.js in each sub-directory.

<strong>Address Book</strong></br>
This JavaScript tool allows you to add in names and addresses and appends them to an unordered list. The list items are clickable to display the added contacts.

<strong>Counter Tool</strong></br>
This tool has three unique counters which allow you to add or decrease by one. You can refresh each counter by clicking the Reset button.
</br></br>
The Delete button currently has no functionality, though it was added with the intention of being able to add and delete entire counter rows. The total in the bottom is also just a placeholder, which would ultimately sum the values in each counter.

<strong>Do NOT Click</strong>
This take on the classic "Do Not Click" button that scolds you when you click it iterates through a series of comments before looping back to the beginning. Side divs (in blue) were used to ensure proper centering of the button on the page.

<strong>High Low Game</strong></br>
This complete game allows you to play a guessing game with the computer, which randomly chooses a number between 1 and 100 and compares your guess to it. You will lose if you don't correctly guess the number after 7 tries.

<strong>JavaScriptPrac.html</strong></br>
This practice page has inline styling and a script on the page, which allows you to edit the text of the header, and also changes the color of the header. If you don't like the change, it reverts to the original.

<strong>Looping Practice</strong></br>
This project taught me how to use Javascript loops. 

<strong>Tic Tac Toe Game</strong></br>
This game makes use of alerts to take the user's name, alert the user's turn, and alert wins and ties. Further functionality would replace these alerts with changed text fields on the page, a score counter, and an option to play against the computer.

<strong>To Do List</strong></br>
This to do list uses bootstrap styling and three divs (which float for adjusted browser widths). Tasks are automatically added to the To Do category, and are moved to the Completed category on a button click. From either div, tasks can also be deleted.
